Image Resizer Script
====================

This is a simple script for resizing .png, .bmp, .jpg and .gif formatted images. There is a simple command line version which takes in 2 system arguments and should be used like this:

$python image_resizer_CMD.py [image_directory] [output_directory]

There is also a GUI version available and usage is pretty easy. Simply select the correct directories and it will automatically resize all of them.

Keep in mind that this script will not enlarge the images and it will maintain aspect ratio according to the minimum heights and widths that are provided by you.
